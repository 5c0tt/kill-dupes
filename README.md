#Kill-Dupes
Scans a given directory, using hashes, finds any duplicate files and deletes them all leaving you with just one.  New files an be added and subtracted and it will keep scanning and doing the right thing.

#Use Case
I had an old media server, one directory held all my music. It was too hard to figure out what I already had and did not have, so I just dumped audio files into a directory.  This script would scan it, and remove any duplicates.
