#Kill-Dupes
Scans a given directory, using hashes, finds an =y duplicate files and deletes them all leaving you with just one.  New files an be added and subtracted and it will keep scanning and doing the right thing.

#Use Case
I had an old media server, one directory held all my music. It was too hard to figure out what I already had and did not have, so I just dumped audio files into a directory.  This script would scan it, and remove any duplicates.
